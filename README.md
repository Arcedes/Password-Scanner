# Password Scanner (Java)

This Java program reads a list of passwords from a text file (`pwd.txt`) and evaluates them based on the following rules:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (@, #, %, -, &, *)

It outputs two files:
- `validpwd.txt` – valid passwords
- `invalidpwd.txt` – invalid passwords

## How to Use
1. Add your passwords (one per line) in `pwd.txt`.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Check the output files.
